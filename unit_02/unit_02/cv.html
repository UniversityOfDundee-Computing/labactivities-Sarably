    <h2>Enployment History</h2>

    <br>

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>I often find humour in staring at blank ceilings for hours on end. The minimalism of the ceilings helps to stimulate my brain as there is nothing there to distract me from my thoughts. My speculations have often led to me being compared to great philosophers such as Ted Kaczynski and Friedrich Nietzsche. I have also been known to excel at tests of sobriety which gave me a nice passive income.</p>
